Custom compilation

The default Makefile provided with faster2 uses g++ compiler and
assumes that the Boost library has been installed in the standard location.
If this is not the case, the Makefile can be easily customized to
use different compiler and/or use any non-standard Boost installation.

To use different compiler edit the CXX and CXXFLAGS variable.
For instance to use Clang set:

CXX=clang++

To use any non-standard Boost installation uncomment and customize
BOOST_INCLUDE and BOOST_LIB variables. The first one should be set
to where Boost headers are installed. The second one should point to
the directory with Boost libraries. For instance, if Boost has been
installed in /usr/local/boost then set:

BOOST_INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/boost/include
BOOST_LIB=-L/usr/local/boost/lib
